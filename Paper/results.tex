The maximum resolvable frequency on a mesh with grid size $\Delta$ and
average horizontal wind speed $\bar{U}_{horiz}$ can be estimated as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fmax}
  f_{max} = \frac{0.6\bar{U}_{horiz}}{N\Delta}.
\end{equation}
Here, equation \ref{eq:fmax} assumes that the turbulent eddies convect
with a velocity of $0.6\bar{U}_{horiz}$ and $N=8$ is chosen for the
purposes of this study.  Due to the alignment of the flow with the
mesh directions, the grid size $\Delta = \sqrt{2}\cdot \textrm{dx}$.

The wind spectra
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^\infty S_i(f) \textrm{d}f = \sigma_i^2
\end{equation}

The two-point correlation tensor defined as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Rij}
  R_{ij}({\mathbf x},\boldsymbol{\xi}) = 
  \frac{\overline{ {u'_i(\mathbf{x}, t) u'_j(\mathbf{x}+\boldsymbol{\xi},t)} }}
       { \sqrt{\overline{ u'^2_i }} \sqrt{\overline{ u'^2_j}} }

where the velocity fluctuations $u'_i$ are defined as 
\begin{equation}
  u'_i(\mathbf{x},t) = u_i(\mathbf{x},t) - \overline{ u_i(\mathbf{x},t) }
\end{equation}

The horizontally averaged correlation coefficient $\langle
R_{ij}(\boldsymbol{\xi})\rangle$ is computed from
$R_{ij}(\mathbf{x},\boldsymbol{\xi})$ by sampling over ...
