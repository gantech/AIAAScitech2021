\subsection{\label{sec:gridstudy}Domain and grid resolution study}

In order to ensure that the large and small turbulence scales were
properly resolved in the offshore LES simulations, the appropriate
domain size and mesh resolution needed to be determined.
Under-resolved meshes or domain sizes which are too small may miss the
smaller turbulence scales or remove the larger structures required for
proper ABL development.  However, over-resolved meshes or
unnecessarily large domains might lead to excessive computational
requirements to complete the simulations.

The appopriateness of these meshes and domain sizes were determined
based on wind spectra and integral length scale they were able to capture.

The maximum resolvable frequency on a mesh with grid size $\Delta$ and
average horizontal wind speed $\bar{U}_{horiz}$ can be estimated as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fmax}
  f_{max} = \frac{0.6\bar{U}_{horiz}}{N\Delta}.
\end{equation}
Here, equation \ref{eq:fmax} assumes that the turbulent eddies convect
with a velocity of $0.6\bar{U}_{horiz}$ and $N=8$ is chosen for the
purposes of this study.  Due to the alignment of the flow with the
mesh directions, the grid size $\Delta = \sqrt{2}\cdot \textrm{dx}$.
