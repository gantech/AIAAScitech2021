\section{Methodology}
Write something about what we're comparing with, the codes we're
using, and how we set up the simulations.

\subsection{Measured offshore conditions}
\fxnote{Lawrence write this part}

Following the work of Cheung et al \cite{cheung2020large}, we use
measurements of the offshore coastal marine boundary layer, collected
by the Cape Wind meteorological tower in Nantucket Sound, as the basis
for this computational study.  The Cape Wind platform collected wind
measurements at 20m, 41m, and 60m above the mean water level, along
with temperature and barometric measurements from the years 2003-2011.
From the observations, Archer et al.\cite{archer2016predominance}
found that the marine boundary layer is predominantly unstable, with
61\% of conditions classified as unstable, versus 21\% neutral and
18\% stable.  The stratification of the marine boundary layer, as
determined by the Obukhov length, also had a large impact on the wind
speed profile, with flatter, non-logarithmic profiles seen during
unstable conditions.

From the measured distribution of atmospheric stabilities, turbulent
kinetic energies (TKE), and wind speeds from the Cape Wind platform, a
specific set of conditions were chosen as targets for this
computational study.  A summary of the conditions for all stability
classes is given table \ref{tab:CapeWindMeasurements}. In this work we
focus on the three stable atmospheric conditions at wind speeds of
5m/s, 10m/s, and 15m/s, while the neutral and unstable conditions
where studied in previous work \cite{cheung2020large}.

To maintain consistency with the measured data, the turbulence
intensity (TI) is calculated using the TKE as
\begin{equation}
  \textrm{TI} =
  \frac{\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}\times\textrm{TKE}}}{\overline{U}_{horiz}} =
  \frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}\left( \overline{u'u' + v'v' + w'w'}
      \right)}}{\overline{U}_{horiz}}
\end{equation}
The averaged wind speeds were enforced at the measurement height of
20m, and the wind directions...
